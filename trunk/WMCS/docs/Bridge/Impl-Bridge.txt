1. Although in this vmcs application, it is highly possible that we only need to implement one 
	property file system, say txt file for example. But it will still be better if we use bridge 
	design pattern to do a separation for the exact implementation of property file system and 
	the abstracted interfaces, because when some specific changed need to be made on the property
	file readings, we only need to re-link the whole system rather than re-compile the whole system.

2. When this vmcs system is designed to be deployed on different platforms, on the implementation side
	we use a parameter in the constructor to decide which platform interfaces should be used, in other 
	words, we will choose the correct implementer dynamically. In this case, the abstract factory 
	pattern also can be applied.
