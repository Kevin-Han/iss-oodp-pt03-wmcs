1. Direct mapping subjects to their observers. Since in this application, there are only a few 
	subjects need to be observed such as CashStoreItem and DrinkStoreItem, storage is not a problem.

2. Within this system, the TransactionController, MaintenanceController and MachineryController are the
	observers of CashStoreItem and DrinkStoreItem, in order that each controller can know which subject
	is sending the update notification, we put a parameter of the subject itself to indicate the observers.

3. Subject will be responsible for sending the notification. Because all of the backend controller need to 
	immediately know the updated information of CashStoreItem and DrinkStoreItem.
