1. Because for every single UI Factory, typically we only need one instance, we use singleton design pattern per UI factory.
2. For each UI factory, we can apply factory method pattern or prototype pattern. Since in this case, the UI components like buttons, labels, layouts, combox and images etc are 
   different from each other, instead of the prototype design pattern, we will use factory method pattern to create each special UI component.
3. Adding a parameter to the UI component creation interfaces so that we can more easily to extend any other possible UI components.
